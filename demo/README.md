# Demo

Running `py main.py ./data/situation1-1.pl` from the project root should result in the following three PDF files being generated and displayed:
1. [./situation1-1-combined.pdf](./situation1-1-combined.pdf)
2. [./situation1-1-has-moved.pdf](./situation1-1-has-moved.pdf)
2. [./situation1-1-has-not-moved.pdf](./situation1-1-has-not-moved.pdf)

The first file contains all objects, with those that have moved between situation1-1 and situation1-2 highlighted in red.

The second file contains only objects that have moved, while the third file contains all other objects.
